# UNAL-OOP-Domotic-Simulator
Python-based domotic circuit simulator developed for Object-Oriented Programming (UNAL)

This repository contains the academic project *Domotic Circuit Simulator*, developed for the Object-Oriented Programming course at Universidad Nacional de Colombia.  
The project is structured across three workshops, each focused on a different stage of the software design process.

## Workshop Overview

### **Workshop 1 – Conceptual Design**
Focuses on the initial analysis and conceptual modeling of the domotic simulator.
Includes requirements, user stories, CRC cards, and early mockups.

### **Workshop 2 – Technical Design and UML**
Expands the conceptual model into a full technical blueprint.
Includes UML diagrams, OOP implementation planning, and initial Python class definitions.

### **Workshop 3 – SOLID Principles**
Refines the project using SOLID design principles.
Includes updated UML, refactored class responsibilities, code snippets, and a reflective analysis.
