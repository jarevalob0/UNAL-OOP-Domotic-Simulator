#Workshop 1 – Conceptual Design

This folder contains the deliverables for Workshop 1 of the Domotic Circuit Simulator project.  
The goal of this stage was to build the conceptual foundation of the system before any technical implementation.

##Contents
- **Requirements Documentation:** Functional and non-functional requirements defining user needs.
- **User Stories:** Scenarios describing how different types of users interact with the simulator.
- **CRC Cards:** Initial class structure, responsibilities, and collaborations.
- **Mockups:** Visual sketches of the interface, including the main dashboard and circuit editor.

## Purpose
This workshop establishes the project’s initial vision and ensures that all further development aligns with user needs and system behavior.
